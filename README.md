# YouSync
A really bad way to sync the same video playback across multiple computers. (But it works at least)
# How it works
Ok, read these first.
1. Why are you here?
2. Are you sure you want to use this really sketchy way to sync playback.
3. No really, there are like 20 better ways to do this. Heres a website that does it better than me. [Watch2Gether](https://www.watch2gether.com)
4. It was written all in one html file, still trust it?
Alright, you really want to know how this works. Fine.
## To use
- Find your youtube video
- Copy it's id eg. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=**c6fgPNPIekE**
- Paste it to the box and press **Generate Link**
- Copy your id that the website creates and reload the page
- Paste that in to the box on your computer and any others you wish to sync and press join
- Press the start videos button from any of the computers. **NOTE** once you start playback you cannot stop it (not even the built in pause button works)

Enjoy
